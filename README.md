# A Collection of Smart Contracts
This is a collection of Smart Contracts. Big shoutout to [HASHLIPS](https://github.com/HashLips), his youtube tutorials provided most of the starter code/inspiration for this repo. The beauty of smart contracts is that you put your trust in the code itself, instead of the man. Code is law :). As i continue to work on more crypto related projects I will update this repo with more template smart contracts, hopefully you come across one that you find helpful.
