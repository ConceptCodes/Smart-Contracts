# A Collection of Smart Contracts
This is a collection of Smart Contracts. Big shoutout to [HashLips](https://github.com/HashLips) & [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) because their youtube tutorials provided most of the starter code/inspiration for this repo. The beauty of smart contracts is that you put your trust in the code itself instead of man. Code is law :). As I continue to work on crypto-related projects, more smart contracts will be added to this repo. Hopefully, you come across one that you find helpful.
